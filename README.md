# Classical machine learning
This repository contains the code for some classical machine learning algorithms for both classifiction and regression tasks. The algorithms were implemented from scratch in Python. 

The repository contains the following machine learning algorithms:
- KNNeighbours (K-Nearest Neighbours)
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Perceptron
- Decision Tree
